Arch, Manjaro, etc

# Installation instructions
You can install the configurations by running the following command:

    $ curl -L http://url | bash

The install script will ensure that the following packages are installed:
  1. git
  2. curl
  3. vim

It will then clone the repo and symbolically link the configurations.

Then it installs [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
